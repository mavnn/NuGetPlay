Feature: Floating operations should work

Scenario outline: Installing a package with versioned directory should work
	Given a floating directory
	When I install <package> with versioned directory
	Then the package should be installed with a versioned directory

	Examples:

	| package |
	| Ninject |

Scenario outline: Installing a package with specific version should work
	Given a floating directory
	When I install <package>, version <version> with versioned directory
	Then the package should be installed with a versioned directory

	Examples:

	| package | version  |
	| Ninject | 3.0.1.10 |
	| Ninject | 2.2.1.4  |

Scenario: Installing a package with dependency should work
	Given a floating directory
	When I install Nuget.Core, version 2.7.2 with versioned directory
	Then the package should be installed with a versioned directory
	And it's dependency Microsoft.Web.Xdt should be installed

Scenario: Installing a package with dependencies ignored should work
	Given a floating directory
	When I install Nuget.Core, version 2.7.2 with no dependencies and a versioned directory
	Then the package should be installed with a versioned directory
	And it's dependency Microsoft.Web.Xdt should not be installed

Scenario: Installing a package without versioned directory
	Given a floating directory
	When I install Ninject with versioned directory
	Then the package should be installed without a versioned directory
